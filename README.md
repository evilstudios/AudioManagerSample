# Evil Studios Technical Test
This test is intended to evaluate, at a simple level, your basic coding practices and strategies with Objective-C.

## Do & Do Nots
- Do *clone* this repo and create your own public repo, using a different name for the project.
- Do not *fork* this repo. Your work should remain your own, and not visible to others.
- Do not use Swift; only use Objective-C for this test. (Although we are slowly migrating to Swift in our code base, it is 98% Objective-C, and so this is the skill we care about.)
- Do use Xcode 7.2 to make your project.
- Do focus on "proper" naming and coding practices, syntax, and style, including class and variable naming.

## Technical Test Details
We would like you to build a singleton that is responsible for playing short to medium length audio clips from within an iOS9 application. Let's call this singleton the "Sound Manager".

The Sound Manager's purpose is to provide an API to play an audio clip immediately (you may use the clips in this project). Assume that the Audio Manager is being used by a developer other than yourself and may need to be extended in the future.

Additional UI and sound-related features may be added at your discretion.

## Test Tasklist
1) *Clone* this repo, and create a public copy of it, using some unique name of your choice. (Do *not* fork this repo.)
2) Build a singleton, with an API to play sound files.
3) Build a basic UI on top of the API (i.e. to play the sound).
4) Add other features to the singleton (if you like), or more fancy sound/action UI that you want us to see.
5) Send us your completed project, via GitHub link.
